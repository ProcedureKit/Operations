/**
 ResilientNetworkProcedure is a RetryProcedure subclass which together with ResilientNetworkBehavior
 protocol enables framework consumers to write _network resilient procedures_. Network resiliency
 refers to the practice of client and server working together in order to withstand network failures,
 network conjestion and other types of network errors.

 Typically this is most easily understood by a client not repeatedly requesting data in the event
 of an error from the server. Typically framework consumers will want to define their own rules
 for the client, such as how many retries should be attemted, or what backoff strategy between
 attempts, and which HTTP response error codes should be retried. This is business logic is
 encapsulated by the ResilientNetworkBehavior protocol. Clients should implement this on
 a type, which it uses to initialize the procedure with.

 For the actual network request, this can be any operation (which conforms to ResultInjection)
 where the result is (Data, HTTPURLResponse)?. For example, see NetworkDataProcedure.
