An `Operation` subclass which enables the grouping

related operations together, thereby creating higher
levels of abstractions.

Additionally, `GroupOperation`s are useful as a way
of creating Operations which may repeat themselves before
subsequent operations can run. For example, authentication
operations.

    /**
     This method is called every time one of the groups child operations
     is about to finish.

     Over-ride this method to enable the following sort of behavior:

     ## Error handling.

     Typically you will want to have code like this:

        if !errors.isEmpty {
            if operation is MyOperation, let error = errors.first as? MyOperation.Error {
                switch error {
                case .AnError:
                  println("Handle the error case")
                }
            }
        }

     So, if the errors array is not empty, it is important to know which kind of
     errors the operation may have encountered, and then implement handling of
     any that are necessary.

     Note that if an operation has conditions, which fail, they will be returned
     as the first errors.

     ## Move results between operations.

     Typically we use `GroupOperation` to
     compose and manage multiple operations into a single unit. This might
     often need to move the results of one operation into the next one. So this
     can be done here.

     - parameter operation: the child `NSOperation` that has just finished.
     - parameter errors: an array of `ErrorType`s.
